Prefab for `room_goto_transition()` that captures the screen content in a surface, goes to the specified room, renders that room to a surface and uses the two surfaces to render a transition.
The transitions are MIT shaders from https://gl-transitions.com
Currently 55 different transitions, most of them configurable, have been added.
